Got away clean with my fake ID
No more school or mommy for me
Stealin' cars, and breaking hards
Pills and thrills and actin' smart.

Dead end kids in the danger zone
All of you are drunk and stoned
Dead end kids, you're not alone
You sleep in the streets when you're not at home

In the naked city
Spaces ain't that pretty
AS I was getting dusted
I happened to get busted
Oh, yes, I was arrested
Oh God, how I protested
They beat me with a board
It hurt just like a sword
They kicked me in the eye
My brain began to fry
